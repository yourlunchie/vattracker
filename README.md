Note: currenttrackstemplate.json is meant to be empty, the code will populate and clear the JSON by default. However, you must rename it to 
```
currenttracks.json
```
before starting the program. This is to ensure that if you are pulling from github, no data in that json will be lost.

Development branch, expect bugs
